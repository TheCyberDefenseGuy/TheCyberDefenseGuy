# The CyberDefense Guy

## About

I am a security architect with a strong background in network security, identity,
Zero Trust and large-scale enterprise environments.

My focus is on adversary-informed defensive design, detection strategy and security
telemetry architecture — exploring how architectural decisions impact attacker
behavior, visibility and response effectiveness.

This GitHub is a collection of practical analyses, architectural patterns and
defensive thinking aimed at reducing blind spots, false confidence and attacker dwell time.

## Areas of Interest

- Detection Engineering & Threat-Informed Defense
- Adversarial Security Architecture
- Network Segmentation & Zero Trust
- Identity-Centric Security
- Security Telemetry & Monitoring
- Purple Team Thinking

## Philosophy

Security controls do not fail in isolation.
They fail when architecture, detection and enforcement are disconnected.

Effective defense assumes failure,
observes behavior and contains adversaries early.
